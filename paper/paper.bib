abstract = {This study introduces a new method of extracting initial and final contact gait time events from vertical acceleration, measured with one waist mounted inertial measurement unit, by means of continuous wavelet transforms. The method was validated on 18 young healthy subjects and compared to two others available in the literature. Of the three methods investigated, the new one was the most accurate at identifying the existence and timing of initial and final contacts with the ground, with an average error of 0.02. ±. 0.02. s and 0.03. ±. 0.03. s (approximately 2{\%} and 3{\%} of mean stride duration), respectively. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper studies the feasibility of an analysis of spatio-temporal gait parameters based upon accelerometry. To this purpose, acceleration patterns of the trunk and their relationships with spatio-temporal gait parameters were analysed in healthy subjects. Based on model predictions of the body's centre of mass trajectory during walking, algorithms were developed to determine spatio-temporal gait parameters from trunk acceleration data. In a first experiment, predicted gait parameters were compared with gait parameters determined from ground reaction forces measured by a treadmill. In a second experiment, spatio-temporal gait parameters were determined during overground walking. From the results of these experiments, it is concluded that, in healthy subjects, the duration of subsequent stride cycles and left/right steps, and estimations of step length and walking speed can be obtained from lower trunk accelerations. The possibility to identify subsequent stride cycles can be the basis for an analysis of other signals (e.g. kinematic or muscle activity) within the stride cycle. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

@article{Najafi2003,
abstract = {A new method of physical activity monitoring is presented, which is able to detect body postures (sitting, standing, and lying) and periods of walking in elderly persons using only one kinematic sensor attached to the chest. The wavelet transform, in conjunction with a simple kinematics model, was used to detect different postural transitions (PTs) and walking periods during daily physical activity. To evaluate the system, three studies were performed. The method was first tested on 11 community-dwelling elderly subjects in a gait laboratory where an optical motion system (Vicon) was used as a reference system. In the second study, the system was tested for classifying PTs (i.e., lying-to-sitting, sitting-to-lying, and turning the body in bed) in 24 hospitalized elderly persons. Finally, in a third study monitoring was performed on nine elderly persons for 45-60 min during their daily physical activity. Moreover, the possibility-to-perform long-term monitoring over 12 h has been shown. The first study revealed a close concordance between the ambulatory and reference systems. Overall, subjects performed 349 PTs during this study. Compared with the reference system, the ambulatory system had an overall sensitivity of 99{\%} for detection of the different PTs. Sensitivities and specificities were 93{\%} and 82{\%} in sit-to-stand, and 82{\%} and 94{\%} in stand-to-sit, respectively. In both first and second studies, the ambulatory system also showed a very high accuracy ({\textgreater} 99{\%}) in identifying the 62 transfers or rolling out of bed, as well as 144 different posture changes to the back, ventral, right and left sides. Relatively high sensitivity ({\textgreater} 90{\%}) was obtained for the classification of usual physical activities in the third study in comparison with visual observation. Sensitivities and specificities were, respectively, 90.2{\%} and 93.4{\%} in sitting, 92.2{\%} and 92.1{\%} in "standing + walking," and, finally, 98.4{\%} and 99.7{\%} in lying. Overall detection errors (as percent of range) were 3.9{\%} for "standing + walking," 4.1{\%} for sitting, and 0.3{\%} for lying. Finally, overall symmetric mean average errors were 12{\%} for "standing + walking," 8.2{\%} for sitting, and 1.3{\%} for lying.},

abstract = {Measurement of gait is becoming important as a tool to identify disease and disease progression, yet to date its application is limited largely to specialist centres. Wearable devices enables gait to be measured in naturalistic environments however questions remain regarding validity. Previous research suggests that when compared with a laboratory reference, measurement accuracy is acceptable for mean but not variability or asymmetry gait characteristics. Some fundamental reasons for this have been presented (e.g. synchronisation, different sampling frequencies) but to date this has not been systematically examined. The aims of this study were to: (i) quantify a comprehensive range of gait characteristics measured using a single tri-axial accelerometer-based monitor, (ii) examine outcomes and monitor performance in measuring gait in older adults and those with Parkinson's disease (PD) and (iii) carry out a detailed comparison with those derived from an instrumented walkway to account for any discrepancies. Fourteen gait characteristics were quantified in 30 people with incident PD and 30 healthy age-matched controls. Of the 14 gait characteristics compared, agreement between instruments was excellent for 4 (ICCs 0.913 - 0.983); moderate for 4 (ICCs 0.508 - 0.766); and poor for 6 characteristics (ICCs -0.637 - 0.370). Further analysis revealed that differences reflect an increased sensitivity of accelerometry to detect motion, rather than measurement error. This is most likely because accelerometry measures gait as a continuous activity rather than discrete footfall events, per instrumented tools. The increased sensitivity shown for these characteristics will be of particular interest to researchers keen to interpret 'real world' gait data. In conclusion, use of a body worn monitor is recommended for the measurement of gait but is likely to yield more sensitive data for asymmetry and variability features.},

abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the corre-lation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth Interna-tional conference, * * * , 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

@article{Trojaniello2014,
abstract = {In the last decade, various methods for the estimation of gait events and temporal parameters from the acceleration signals of a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) mounted at waist level have been proposed. Despite the growing interest for such methodologies, a thorough comparative analysis of methods with regards to number of extra and missed events, accuracy and robustness to IMU location is still missing in the literature. The aim of this work was to fill this gap. Five methods have been tested on single IMU data acquired from fourteen healthy subjects walking while being recorded by a stereo-photogrammetric system and two force platforms. The sensitivity in detecting initial and final contacts varied between 81{\%} and 100{\%} across methods, whereas the positive predictive values ranged between 94{\%} and 100{\%}. For all tested methods, stride and step time estimates were obtained; three of the selected methods also allowed estimation of stance, swing and double support time. Results showed that the accuracy in estimating step and stride durations was acceptable for all methods. Conversely, a statistical difference was found in the error in estimating stance, swing and double support time, due to the larger errors in the final contact determination. Except for one method, the IMU positioning on the lower trunk did not represent a critical factor for the estimation of gait temporal parameters. Results obtained in this study may not be applicable to pathologic gait.},
